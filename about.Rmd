## What are we? 

We are a small group who are working within NCI to evaluate the NCI cloud pilots.
Our initial mandate was to use the NCI Intramural Research Program to 
evaluate the NCI cloud pilots. Knowing that adoption of the NCI cloud pilots
into researchers' workflows and practices would take significant training,
we started to develop lightweight training and workshop materials, almost
all of which are hosted here. We are also interested in interfacing with individual
groups to adopt cloud technologies where appropriate in support of faster, better,
more effective science. Finally, we have developed an online community based on 
Slack that serves as a growing interest group and discussion forum on the growing
ecosystem of cloud-enabled and interrelated technologies for genomics and other
computational biology.
